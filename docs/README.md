# Tutorial: LinuxIT-TCP-IP

This project is a **TCP server** designed to *listen for incoming connections* from clients. Its primary function is to **process commands** received over the network, with a core focus on *detecting normal and defected pears* using an integrated **AI model**. The system also allows clients to *manage the AI model* itself and *configure image processing directories*.
